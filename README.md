# Practice
          This is a github repository solely for purpose of doing coding in different languages. There is a different folder for the each programming language.
          In that folder you will find all the resources that have been posted here which will contain the exercises, some projects and different program. Other branch will
          be a different branch, so checkout the branch as well for some weekly data challanges.
