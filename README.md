# Practice
          This is a github repository solely for purpose of doing coding in different languages. There is a different folder for the each programming language.
          In that folder you will find all the resources that have been posted here which will contain the following.
# Notes:
          If somone wants to commit any kind of code or a file that covers one concept of programming, they must give a file with .docx extension with same name as of
          that program file, for example if you want to commit and create a new file with ipynb extension, you must create a file with .docx extension of the same name.
          Now in that file the methodaology should be written, the flow chart should be written, if not please request somone to add it and the code editor they used.
          With these there must be a brief note and explanation of the concept with some real life example.
